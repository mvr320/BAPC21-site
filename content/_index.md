## First upcoming contest: AAPP 2019, see details on [FB](http://tiny.cc/aapp2019)
### Who are we?

**ICPC VU Amsterdam**, also known as the AAPP Committee, organizes programming contests for students at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The committee is supported by [STORM](https://storm.vu/), the study association for Mathematics, Computer Science and related studies at the VU.

Our committee consists entirely of students. Please let us know at aapp@storm.vu if you are interested in joining.

You can also find us on Facebook [here](https://www.facebook.com/icpcVU/).

### What is a programming contest?

During an ICPC programming contest, teams of up to 3 competitors try to solve a number of programming problems in limited time (typically 5 hours). The problem set is made by a jury, and you recieve a copy at the start of the contest. For each problem, the teams must design an algorithm to solve itm and implement their solution in a programming language of their choice. The code is then submitted to the jury, who use automated judging servers to run the code on a number of test cases.

If the submitted code works as expected on all the input data, a verdict of ACCEPTED is given. Other possible verdicts include WRONG ANSWER and TIME LIMIT EXCEEDED.

Each problem that is solved successfully gives a team 1 point. At the end, the team with the most points wins. In the case of ties, which is quite common, a time penalty is used to determine the winner. Each successful submission gives a penalty that grows larger the later it was submitted: 1 time penalty for each minute since the contest started. Every unsuccesful submission gives another 20 time penalties (but only if the team gets that problem right in the end; unsuccesful submissions for unsolved problems do not count).

For more information about the judging system, consult the [DOMjudge Team Manual](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/team-manual.pdf).

### Contests

AAPJE is the Amsterdam Algorithm Programming Junior Event. It takes place every year in April or May, and is designed primarily for first year students. The problems at this contest are a bit easier, as they are made to be solvable with only basic programming experience. AAPJE is usually held on a weekday evening, and the contest is 3 hours long instead of the usual 5.

AAPP, the Amsterdam Algorithm Programming Preliminary, is held every September. This is a preliminary round for the BAPC. The best 2 to 5 teams at the AAPP advance to the BAPC. The number of teams that advances depends on their performance and the available space at the BAPC.

The [BAPC](http://bapc.eu/) (Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest) takes place every October at a university in the Benelux. This contest is not hosted by the AAPP Committee, but is organized by its own committee. BAPC 2018 will take place on October 27th 2018 at the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain.

Doing well at the BAPC can earn you a trip to NWERC (North-Western Europe Regional Contest). The 2 highest scoring VU teams at the BAPC can take part in NWERC, with some expenses paid. In 2018, NWERC will come to the Netherlands: it will be hosted at the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven.

We also host a hub for [Google Hash Code](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/) at the Vrije Universiteit. Hash Code is a team programming competition organized by Google for students and industry professionals across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
