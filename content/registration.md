# Registration

Registration will be opened after the preliminaries have taken place. Those are expected to be held in the Summer. Registration for a preliminary is independent of registration for BAPC21 and info on how the register for a team representing your own university/school is mostly registered via your teaching staff or the study association representing either Math or Computer Science.
